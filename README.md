**Classification of True or False Arryhthmia ECG Alarms in the ICU**

This repository contains supplementary materials from a research project for determining whether an ECG arrhythmia alarm in the ICM is a true alarm or a false alarm. This is done by classifying the ECG segment immediately following an alarm into either that of a true alarm or a false alarm, as accurately as possible and as early as possible. This research resulted in an advancement of the state of the art, mostly resulting from 2015 PhysioNet/CinC Challenge (https://www.physionet.org/content/challenge-2015/1.0.0/).
